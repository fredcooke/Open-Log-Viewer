This project uses MiGLayout instead of the generic layout managers

miglayout-3.7-swing.jar to be exact
it is included

Tested in Kubuntu and Ubuntu 10.04 from bash
with MigLayout installed from Apt
 javac -extdirs /usr/share/java OpenLogReader/Main.java

that will compile it
running it from there ~shrug~


I'm a java novice, this is a netbeans project, load it as one for simplicity

This project currently only supports MegaTunix logs and Tuner Studio logs
or anything simalarly formatted
